Hi! I'm Yoray, AKA Vaktibabat. I am a third-year Computer Science student at the Open University of Israel. 
In my spare time, I research and learn topics that interest me, mostly cybersecurity-related ones.
The goal of this blog is to document my learning and also to teach the readers cool things :)

Hope you'll enjoy!

Yoray
