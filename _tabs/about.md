I started this blog about two years ago on a whim, with the chief purpose being to improve my CTF and Cybersecurity skills, after having another blog which I didn't really like.

Since then, I've started using this blog as a platform to explore whichever topics I'm interested in, with the guiding principle being Feynman's quote "What I cannot create, I do not understand": from [Implementing a Deep-Q Network from Scratch in Rust](https://vaktibabat.github.io/posts/DQN_Rust_Blackjack/), to [solving a classic cryptography MPC problem](https://vaktibabat.github.io/posts/smpc_circuits/), through [implementing biology-inspired](https://vaktibabat.github.io/posts/Genetic_Algo_Rust/) [optimization algorithms in multiple languages](https://vaktibabat.github.io/posts/antcolony/), I'm exploring a very diverse set of topics, learning a lot from both implementation and writing.

Hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoy writing,
Yoray
